# Weather Dashboard

This brilliant weather dashboard uses OpenWeather's Current Weather Data AND One Call APIs in order to allow the user to search for any given city in the world and recieve the current date, an icon indicitive of the weather, temp, wind speed, humidity, and uv index (color coded using an if statement which applies different backgrounds to uv indexes between 0 and 2, 3 and 5, 6 and 7, 8 and 10, and above 11).
The user will ALSO be presented with a 5-day forecast consisting of the date, an icon, average temp, wind speed, and humidity.
Once a city has been searched, that city is added to a list of fancily bootstrap styled buttons which, when clicked, present the user with the current weather information for that city.
These buttons are saved to localStorage and up to the most recent 10 searches will be displayed when the page is reloaded.
